Introduction
------------

Pseudo-Code (called p-code from now on) is a stepping stone between a language like English and
a computer language. P-Code is more formal than English, but does not require you to decided on
"trivial" details about a computation.

P-code is an excellent software design tool. It allows you to develop a program's logic without
getting bogged down in detail; yet it gives your design a form that resembles a program, making
it easier to implement your design than is the case when using other, graphical techniques

The p-code described in this document was developed by myself. It was developed to primarily
support C/C++ programming; however, it could easily be used to support other languages as well.
The influence of Ada on the design is apparent.

Although this p-code supports ways of defining both procedures and data, it does not (directly)
support package level modularity, exception handling, concurrency, abstract data types, or
object oriented programming. The syntax could be extended on the fly to accommodate some of
these things. However, it is my feeling that other design techniques may be more appropriate for
these other levels of software. P-code is best suited for describing the logic of individual
functions or procedures.

The heart and soul of p-code is the use of normal, English phrases to describe the actions and
data of a program. These phrases are enclosed in "[ ... ]" pairs to set them off from the formal
"computer language" text around them. The beauty of p-code is that these English phrases can
hide any amount of complexity. They allow you to defer difficult problems until you have worked
out the larger picture.

For example,

     IF [there is more work to do] THEN ...
     [compress the resulting file]
     [process the command]

Each of the phrases above is informative and descriptive, but does not require the writer to
worry about the specifics of the operation suggested. This p-code allows English phrases to be
as large as necessary, perhaps spanning several lines, as long as they do not contain the ']'
character anywhere in their text. Notice that I recommend starting an English phrase with a
lower case letter. This tends to read better in the larger context where the first letter in the
sentence is really a reserved word (such as "IF" above).

Below is the p-code for a function which does a bubble sort. Notice the use of English phrases
to add a bit of informality to the presentation and to hide unimportant details. Even the name
of the function can be deferred by using an English phrase as a description of the function.

     FUNCTION [bubble sort an array of stuff] (
       [the array in question],
       [the number of items in the array]
     ) RETURNS [the sorted array]
     BEGIN
       REPEAT
         FOR [every overlapping pair of elements in the array] LOOP
           IF [the pair is out of order] THEN
             [swap them]
           END
         END
       UNTIL [no swapping is necessary]
     END

P-code does not deal with data types. Instead it deals with descriptions of data items.
Defining and using appropriate data types is a matter for the implementation of a p-coded
routine.

Control Structures
------------------

The function body of a p-code program is written using the following control structures

     * Action statements
     * FOR ... LOOP ...
     * WHILE ... LOOP ...
     * IF ... THEN ... ELSE ...
     * REPEAT ... UNTIL ...
     * SWITCH ... CASE ..., etc

Also the BREAK and CONTINUE statements can be used to control loop iterations. You may notice
that these structures are based on the C language. However, the p-code developed here can be
used effectively for a variety of languages. Also, since p-code is not a computer language,
there is no real prohibition against making up your own control structures on the fly. For
example, you could use an English phrase to simply describe the operation you wish to do rather
than use one of the control structures defined here.

Action statements are simply English Phrases which describe an action that the program is to
take. It is these action statements that make up the "meat" of the p-code program.

For example,

     [display window]

     [multiply the matrices]

     [obtain a validated response from the user]

     [print an error message]

Action statements provide "filling" for the other control structures.

The FOR loop construction is used to indicate a loop that will run a number of times where the
number does not change after the loop is encountered. Usually you will see it with the word
"each..." For example,

     FOR [each byte in the file] LOOP
       [process the byte]
     END

     FOR [each record in the array] LOOP
       [process the record]
     END

     FOR [each item on the list] LOOP
       [process the item]
     END

The WHILE loop construction is used to indicate a loop that will run an unknown number of times.
For example, the number of times it runs might depend on the processing that takes place in the
loop. For example,

     [get the first number]
     WHILE [the number is not prime] LOOP
       [work up a new number]
     END

The IF construction is used to indicate steps that are to be taken conditionally. For example

     IF [the above does not make sense] THEN
       [perhaps you'd prefer to use flowcharts]
     END

The IF ... ELSE construction is used to indicate two mutually exclusive options. For example

     IF [there was an error] THEN
       [do error handling]
     ELSE
       [do normal processing]
     END

This construction can be combined to form a multi-way branch.

     IF [result is too small] THEN
       [do first kind of error handling]
     ELSE IF [result is just right] THEN
       [do normal processing]
     ELSE
       [do error handling for the case of result too large]
     END

The REPEAT..UNTIL loop is a loop where the test is done at the end of the loop rather than at
the beginning (as with the WHILE loop). This is useful, for example, when interacting with the
user.

     REPEAT
       [get and process a user command]
     UNTIL [user wants to quit]

Notice that the REPEAT..UNTIL loop runs as long as the condition being tested is false. This is
the opposite of the WHILE loop.

The SWITCH construction is used to specify a multi-way branch in a manner that is easier to read
than an IF ... ELSE IF... chain. The word DEFAULT can be used to specify actions that are taken
if none of the cases match.

     SWITCH [key stroke entered by user]
       CASE [space]:
         [handle space]
         END
       CASE [any upper case letter]:
         [handle letters]
         END
       DEFAULT:
         [handle error]
         END
     END

Notice that the word "END" is used after each case to indicate that the case is over. The cases
do not fall through as they do, for example, in C. This does not present any limitation,
however, since the English phrases used with the cases can be as complicated as necessary. For
example

     SWITCH [key stroke entered by user]
       CASE [upper or lower case letter]:
         [handle letter]
         END
       CASE [digit]:
         [handle digit]
         END
     END


Expressions
-----------

In the condition part of WHILE, REPEAT, and IF constructions additional logical operators are
possible. These are NOT, AND, and OR. They have the usual meaning.

     IF [you messed up] OR [I messed up] THEN
       [we have a problem]
     END

The OR operator has the lowest precedence, followed by AND, and finally NOT. Parens can be used
to specify ordering. Since programming languages often differ in their precedence of these
operators, I recommend, in fact, that you use parens liberally in your p-code expressions.

     IF NOT ( [you messed up] OR [I messed up] ) THEN
       [everything's OK]
     END

These logical operators cannot be used with a FOR or SWITCH construction.

In the condition part of WHILE, IF, and REPEAT constructions, zero or more actions can proceed
the conditional part itself. This can be used to indicate certain steps that must be performed
before the condition can really be evaluated. The ability to include such action lists often
simplify the structure of a function. This facility is based on the C language comma operator.
It can be used to express the common C idiom of assigning to a variable as part of the
evaluation of a condition.

For example,

     WHILE [read line from file], [first character is a space] LOOP
       [process a block of lines that begin with spaces]
     END

     IF [there is not enough memory] THEN
       [print error message]
     ELSE IF [display window and get response], [bad option] THEN
       [print a different error message]
     ELSE
       [handle user request]
     END

The BREAK statement forces a immediate exit of the enclosing loop construction. It is often used
at the beginning of a loop to indicate exceptional reasons for stopping a loop early. For
example,

     FOR [every byte in the file] LOOP
       IF [this is a special byte] THEN BREAK END
       [process normal bytes]
     END

The CONTINUE statement forces the next iteration of the enclosing loop construction. It is often
used at the beginning of a loop to indicate that certain passes are to be skipped. For example,

     FOR [every byte in the file] LOOP
       IF [this is a special byte] THEN CONTINUE END
       [process normal bytes]
     END


Functions
---------

Although this p-code is very useful without the formality of creating function definitions there
are times when a p-code programmer would like to clearly document function interfaces.
Accordingly this p-code provides a way to do this. Below is a sample function specification
showing all of the features supported by this pseudo-code. Note that, as with the C language,
this p-code uses the word FUNCTION to describe any kind of callable block of code. Because of
the flexibility of p-code, there is no problem using p-code functions to describe procedures or
methods in languages that support those concepts.

FUNCTION [name of function] REQUIRES [precondition] (
  [function parameter] DOMAIN [domain constraint description],
  [another parameter],
  [yet another parameter]
  ) PROMISES [postcondition]
  RETURNS [what it returns], [another] RANGE [range constraint description]
  BEGIN
    # Function Body
  END

Many functions can only be invoked in a certain context. For example, a function may assume that
a certain graphics package has been initialized, or that some global data is already in a
certain state. These requirements are often called preconditions. If you want to specify a
precondition for a function you can use a REQUIRES clause after the function's name.

A function parameter is type description (see below) that specifies the nature of the data sent
to the function. All data that the function manipulates should be specified in its parameter
list. It is understood that the implementation of the p-code in a real programming language may
use other techniques for transmitting the parameters (for example global variables).

The special parameter of VOID may be used to indicate that the function has no parameters.

A function parameter and a type description may have domain constraints. These are descriptions
of the set of legal values the parameter or type may have. The syntax for domain constraints on
types does not use the DOMAIN keyword since the term "domain" is more commonly associated with
functions. However, the meaning of the constraints in both cases are similar.

TYPE [day of the week] IS [some kind of enumeration] : [no weekends]

FUNCTION [position the cursor] (
  [row and column coordinates] DOMAIN [1..25 for row, 1..80 for column]
  ) RETURNS VOID

Many data structures have rules that always apply to them (sometimes called "invarients"). These
rules can be expressed as domain constraints as well. For example,

TYPE [list of file names] IS [list] OF [just strings] :
  [new names always go on the end]

The postcondition clause is where the function's side effects can be documented. This forms the
"output" end of the function's context. For example

FUNCTION [position the cursor] (
  [row and column coordinates] DOMAIN [1..25 for row, 1..80 for column]
  ) PROMISES [cursor moved to new position] RETURNS VOID

Even though the above function returns VOID data, it still performs a useful operation with a
side effect. This side effect should be documented.

The range of a function is the set of legal values of its output. This range may be constrained,
and such constraints are to be documented here. For example,

FUNCTION [generate a random die roll] (VOID)
  RETURNS [an integer] RANGE [in the range 1..6]

The function body is where the function does the actual work. Here it manipulates its parameters
and calculates its results. Also it is here where the function performs any side effects.

The body is written by using English phrases which describe specific actions, together with
control structures which describe how those actions are to be sequenced. Note also that it is
acceptable in this p-code to nest function definitions and data definitions inside the body as
well.


Type Descriptions
-----------------

Data is described as a type. In a high level language, you typically define both types and
objects. Because of the nature of p-code, however, data objects do not (normally) need to be
explicitly named. The English phrases can usually be worded to make such names superfluous. In
fact, if you find yourself wanting to name a data object in p-code it may mean that you are not
thinking about a properly general design.

Type descriptions take the form shown below.

TYPE [name of type] IS [type descriptor]

where a type descriptor is something like:

     [simple description of type] : [domain constraint description]
or
     [aggregate specifier] OF [type descriptor list] END

where a type descriptor list is a comma separated list of type descriptors.

Types are inherently recursively defined. This is necessary. Also notice that once a type has
been described, it can be used freely as a type descriptor. This is important if the p-code is
to handle abstract data types.

Consider the following simple (ie non aggregate) type descriptions

TYPE [user ID number] IS [some kind of integer] : [range 0 to whatever]
TYPE [date] IS [stores calendar dates] : [only back to 1800]
TYPE [pen color] IS [an enumeration]

Simple descriptions can be used to describe aggregates if you don't desire to spell out the
detailed structure of an aggregate. Otherwise an aggregate specifier can be used.

Many types are really aggregates of simple types. The OF clause allows you to specify the nature
of the aggregate. For example

TYPE [list of filenames] IS [list] OF [just strings] END

Here is how you might specify a list of record (or structure) objects.

TYPE [list of filenames] IS [list] OF
  [a string for the name itself] : [can't hold path],
  [size in bytes]                : [must be able to handle large files!],
  [date and time of last modification]
END

TYPE [registers of calculator] IS [stack] OF [numbers] END

TYPE [error table] IS [record] OF ...

Note that the END keyword is required if the OF keyword is used.
